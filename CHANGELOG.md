## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Syntax Errors in VulnerabilityScanner.tsx**

  - Corrected the structure of `fetchStorageFiles` to use a proper `try { ... } catch { ... }` block.

### Improved
- **Error Handling & User Feedback**
  - Enhanced error messages for scan initiation and report fetching.
  - Improved toast notifications for both success and error scenarios.

  - Improved function boundaries and code readability.

### Security
